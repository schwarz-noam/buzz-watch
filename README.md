# BuzzWatch

## Overview

BuzzWatch is a citizen science project dedicated to tracking mosquito activity. By collecting data on captured mosquitoes, including the time and location of each catch, we aim to understand their activity patterns throughout the year and during different times of the day. This project informs us on the changes we will see because of climate change.

## Motivation

Changing weather patterns have extended mosquito activity periods, which may have contributed to the West Nile fever outbreak in Israel following the winter of 2023-2024. By analyzing our own data, we observe a peak in mosquito activity during the early summer months and significant daytime activity, helping communities take necessary precautions against mosquito bites.
